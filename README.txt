 Goal is to collect all 4, bring them to starting map, and iteract with portal.

Interaction is possible with five types of objects - Shrines, HealingPoints, Vendors, Chests and Artifacts.
Interacting with:
Artifact - gives you said artifact (it appears in upper-left corner of screen), and unlocks additional spell 
Shrines - improve your speed or strength (strength increase damage, and allows for pushing heavier objects)
HealingPoints - heals percentile of your health
Vendors - for a fee increases your max health or casting speed
Chests - gives you 50 gold or unlocks random spell

When you enter, exits are closed until all enemies are dead.
There are two types of enemies:
Warriors, that follow you and try to kill you with their swords.
And mages that cast magics in your general direction.

Stones can be destroyed with basic magic, but it is far easier with special, explosive spell.

And that is it for the basics, rest can be found out with gameplay

Have fun
